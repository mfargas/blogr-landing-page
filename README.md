## My process

Originally, I constructed the site with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
While the process was an initial success, I came across issues that required me to look further into. I have recently grown accustomed to SASS am circling back to this project's styling to better improve its functionality.

The components of interest were the navbar's submenu section, the hamburger changing, and the multiple SVGs handled throughout this project. For this reason, I am restructuring the Vanilla CSS styling to SASS and will look into SGVO for SVG Optimizing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Modern JavaScript
- SVGO
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<label for="toggle">&#9776;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="toggle" />
```
```css
label{
    display: none;
    font-size: 26px;
    width: 25px;
    float: right;
}

nav ul li:focus-within ul{
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->
